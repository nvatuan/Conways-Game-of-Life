# Postscript
[One thing blew my mind is how creative you can be with Conway's.](http://golly.sourceforge.net/)

The first thing that pop up in my mind was Flip-flop. We can use imitate this to store data.

The next thing is I notice certain "builds" will do certain things, similiar to logic gates?! If we use these "builds" to imitate the CPU, I wonder if we can build a computer using this..?
